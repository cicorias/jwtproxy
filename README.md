# jwtproxy
> NOTE: this is a work in progress and early release.

JwtProxy is an Express middleware component that provides a simple way to include within the pipeline.

The aim is to further simplifiy and externalize settings as needed leaning on `dotenv` and `.env` files for local, and environment variables for runtime.

THe package while injected into the pipeline should be easy to disable, modify, etc.
